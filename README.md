# Open-CV
This repository is full of OPEN CV programs for you to use!
To use these you need the following:
- A software or application in which python files can be executed and edited in. Eg:(Python IDLE, Jupyter Notebook etc..)
  - If using Python IDLE, you should have an Open CV module installed in it.
    - If not, then use the instruction in this link to do so: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-opencv-for-python-in-windows/
 - A folder with haarcascade .xml files like 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'.
